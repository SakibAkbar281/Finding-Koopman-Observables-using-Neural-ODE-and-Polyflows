# Finding-Koopman-Observables-using-Neural-ODE-and-Polyflows

## Description

This project is focused on extracting Koopman observables from data using a combination of Polyflow and Neural ODE techniques. The goal is to gain insights into the behavior of complex systems by identifying Koopman eigenfunctions and eigenvalues from time-series data.
